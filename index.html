    <h1 id="heading">Biography</h1>
    <p id="para"><b>1. Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who was born in Germany in 1879. 
         He was known for his groundbreaking work in physics, especially his theory of relativity, which changed the way we understand space, time, and gravity.<br><br>
         2. As a child, Einstein was curious and had a knack for solving puzzles.
         He wasn't always the best student in school, but he was very interested in math and science.<br><br>
         3. In 1905, Einstein published four papers that revolutionized physics.
         One of these papers introduced his famous equation, E=mcÂ², which describes the relationship between energy and mass.<br><br>
         4. Einstein's work earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
         He became a celebrity and traveled around the world giving lectures and sharing his ideas.<br><br>
         5. In 1933, Einstein left Germany because of the rise of the Nazis and moved to the United States,
         where he continued his research and teaching at Princeton University.<br><br>
         6. Throughout his life, Einstein was not only a brilliant scientist but also a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, 
         and social justice. He passed away in 1955, but his ideas continue to inspire scientists and thinkers around the world.<br><br>
         7. "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress,
         giving birth to evolution." - Albert Einstein
